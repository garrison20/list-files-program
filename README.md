# list-files-program
This program is a simple copy of the terminal's "ls" function. Executing the program with no arguments will print all the contents of the folder. Executing the program with a single name passed in as a parameter will print "Found file" if the name exists and belongs to a file, and will print the contents of a directory if the name belongs to a directory. If there are two arguments, the first argument is the file/directory to be checked for existence and the second is the desired directory to check in. Inputting two arguments performs the same function as passing only one argument to the program, except inside the specified directory should it exist. As of right now, this function only works in the next immediate directory; it cannot perform any checks in a directory two levels lower.
